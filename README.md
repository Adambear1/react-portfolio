# [React Portfolio](http://jpreston-alt.github.io/react-portfolio)

## Description

Hi! Thank you for checking out my portfolio. This is a full-stack MERN portfolio-website deployed on Heroku.com utilizing DNS connection with GoDaddy.com. I utilized tools learned from the University of Washington Full Stack Web Development Program, as well as lecturers from Udemy and YouTube to put together the most dynamic, versatile, and user-friendly website to my ability.

From graduating from the Full Stack Program to current enrollment in Python Programming, I have fostered a passion for back-end software and database development. On the portfolio page of the [deployed site](http://adambirgenheier.com) are the "Top Rated" Applications, which are highlighted due to the intricate and serviceable foundations which power and drive the utility of the application.

Thanks for checking it out!
